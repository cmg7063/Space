The pack contains over 150 prefabs in the particle sci-fi style.
All effects are using 2D sprites.

Package works on unity 5.3+ with any rendering path, color space and api (DirectX 9/11/12, OpenGL, openGLES 2.0/3.0).

For using just drag and drop prefab on scene. Also you can use effects in runtime. Like a "Instantiate(EffectPrefab, position, rotation);"
